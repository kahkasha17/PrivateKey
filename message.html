        <p class="responsive-paragraph">
          See, you know me, I’m not good with words, but I’ll just try to write
          something. I don’t even know how to express this, but you really,
          really mean so much to me. I can’t explain it in words, but I know
          you’ll understand. So, my cutie, you are not just my best friend, you
          are my family, and trust me, you are a part of my life that I never
          want to lose. I’ve already lost so much, but I never want to lose
          those memories related to you. Each one is incredibly important to me.
          I don’t know when my situation will improve, but I really want you to
          be there in my good times, just like you’ve been there in my bad
          times. I know, I know I always says that you don't understand me but I
          don’t even understand myself, how would you? But still,you’ve always
          understand me and stood by me, and that means the world to me. Ugh,
          writing this letter is so hard, but imagine the good lines that my
          heart wants to say. I’m so tired now... I’ll stop here.But but but at
          the last I want to say
